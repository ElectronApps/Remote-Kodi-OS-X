# About the project #

Remote Kodi for OS X is a very simple native remote for Kodi/XBMC, written in swift.

The project is being developed by [Carolina Barreiro](https://twitter.com/droideca) and [Adri√°n Moreno](https://twitter.com/zetxek), and suggestions of things to come are needed (in case anyone finds this useful!)

The project uses CocoaPods and is developed in XCode 6.
