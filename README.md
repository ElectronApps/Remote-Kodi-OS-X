# About the project #

Remote Kodi for OS X is a very simple native remote for Kodi/XBMC, written in swift.

The project is being developed by [Carolina Barreiro](https://twitter.com/droideca) and [Adri√°n Moreno](https://twitter.com/zetxek), and suggestions of things to come are needed (in case anyone finds this useful!)

The project uses CocoaPods and is developed in XCode 6.

The idea for the project came after using some mobile remotes for Kodi, where you don't get a response as fast as in a computer, and you also miss the physical response that a computer keyboard provides.'

Please note that for using remote calls to Kodi/XBMC you'll need to [enable JSON RPC server](http://kodi.wiki/view/JSON-RPC_API#Enabling_JSON-RPC)!
